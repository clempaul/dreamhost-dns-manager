# Dreamhost DNS Manager

Dreamhost DNS Manager provides an application to allow you to manage your
Dreamhost DNS settings without having to access the DreamHost Web Panel.

You will need to have an API key with access to "All dns functions", which
you can get from the [Dreamhost Web Panel][webpanel].
